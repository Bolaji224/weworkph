            We all know running a business is not for slackers, and it might involve hiring someone to help you achieve your set goal. It will make no business sense to employ someone as a permanent staff who will be on your payroll, thereby increasing your monthly expenses as a startup that is not financially buoyant.

            Many professionals are also moving from paid jobs to freelancing due to work balance and flexibility. As a company, freelancers provide you with high-quality work at a low cost. It is comforting to know that the risk is very low because the money you deposited for the job will remain in the escrow account until you are satisfied with the quality of the job, and you must approve the release of the funds to the freelancer.

            Some of us love to spend more time with our family, thereby needing the flexibility to choose our working time and the project we work on. Such a person can achieve that through freelancing.
